Bellabeat- How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

Introduction

Bellabeat, cofounded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur is a high-tech company with a potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. It is a compoany that manufactures health-focused smart products for women. Among the products are "Bellabeat app" which provides users health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle and mindfulness habits. "Leaf" and "Time" are products that help users track these afformentioned activities and "Spring" is a water bottle that tracks daily water intake of users. The company also provides membership program for users, which gives user a 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.

Scenario

For this project we have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights will then help guide marketing strategy for the company along with the high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

ASK

We define the problem and objectives of our case study in this step. So, questions guiding our analysis are - 
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

Business Task - 
Analyze tracker data from FitBit tracker to gain insights and discover trends for Bellabeat marketing strategy.

Deliverables -
1. A clear summary of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
6. High-level content recommendations based on analysis 

Key Stakeholders - 
1. Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer
2. Sando Mur: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team
3. Bellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and
reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

PREPARE

In this step data is collected and stored for upcoming analysis. So, Key Tasks here - 
1. Download data and store it appropriately.
2. Identify how it’s organized.
3. Sort and filter the data.
4. Determine the credibility of the data.

For Credibility if data we need information regarding data source, limitations of data and if it is ROCCC(Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current and Cited)

1. Information regarding Data Source
	a. Data is publicly available on Kaggle: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data and stored in 18 csv files.
	b. Generated by respondents from a survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 March 2016 to 12 May 2016.
	c. 30 FitBit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data.
2. Limitations Of Data 
	a. Data was collected in 2016, i.e., 5 years ago as such it may not be relevant anymore.
	b. Sample size of 30 users is very small.
	c. This is survey data therefore, its accuracy or integrity cannot be vouched by us.
3. Is Data ROCCC? Based on this FitBit tracker data, we can say it is -
	a. Reliable - NO - small sample size.
	b. Original - NO - Third party data.
	c. Comprehensive - YES - Matches data from Bellabeat products.
	d. Current - NO - data collected over 5 years ago.
	e. Cited - NO - Third party data.

Now, the data itself. For this project R language has been used. We will load and scan the data, sorting and filtering can also be done but in this case we have not done that explicitly here.
##setup the work directory where the csv files are stored
setwd("/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16")

##Loading the files
EverydayActs <- read.csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
Sleepday <- read.csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")

## scanning the data
EverydayActs %>% count(Id)
Sleepday %>% count(Id)

PROCESS

In this step we find and eliminate any errors and inaccuracies from the data that can get in the way of results. This is done by -
1. Cleaning the data
2. Transforming it into a more useful format.

Key Tasks - 
1. Checking the data for errors .
2. Choose your tools.
3. Transform the data so you can work with it effectively.
4. Document the cleaning process. 

R language has already been chosen as our tool here. Cleaning, and Documentation of the same process is shown below -
## check data info
str(EverydayActs)
str(Sleepday)
## We do this to get a basic layout of the data, like here come to know that "ActivityDate" and "SleepDay" are of char data type instead of Date
	
##Removing null values from the data set
EverydayActs <- na.omit(EverydayActs)
Sleepday <- na.omit(Sleepday)

##check for the missing values
which(is.na(EverydayActs))
which(is.na(Sleepday))
## At this point it should return integer(0) as no missing values are there 

##Check Unique values
n_distinct(EverydayActs$Id)
n_distinct(Sleepday$Id)
##33 unique Ids instead of 30 in the activity Data.

ANALYZE

This is the step where we do analysis on our data to identify trends and relationships. In this there a few trends and relations that can be explored. We will take a look at - 
1. Relationship between Total Steps and Calories
2. Relationship between Total Minutes asleep and Total time in Bed
3. Relationship between Total Steps and Total Minutes asleep
4. User activity trend in minutes.

1. Relationship between Total Steps and Calories
We will use scatter plot through ggplot and will find the correlation between the two parameters.

##plot
ggplot(data = EverydayActs, aes(x = TotalSteps, y = Calories))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(colour = "purple")+ labs(title = 'Calories vs. Total Steps', x = 'Total Steps', y = 'Calories')
#Correlation Formula
cor(EverydayActs$TotalSteps, EverydayActs$Calories, method=c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"))

This gives a positive correlation between total steps and calories burned, which means this can used to target users who want to burn more calories to maintain or loose their weight but don't necessarily have the time to do  gym or yoga regularly.

2. Relationship between Total Minutes asleep and Total time in Bed

##plot
ggplot(data = Sleepday, aes(x = TotalMinutesAsleep, y = TotalTimeInBed))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(colour = "purple")+ labs(title = 'Total Time In Bed vs. Total Minutes Asleep', x = 'Total Minutes Asleep', y = 'Total Time In Bed')
#Correlation Formula
cor(Sleepday$TotalMinutesAsleep, Sleepday$TotalTimeInBed, method=c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"))
  
This gives a positive correlation as well between Total Time In Bed and Total Minutes Asleep, which means this can be used to encourage users to get into bed earlier in order to get the recommend amount of sleep.

3. Relationship between Total Steps and Total Minutes asleep
For this we will have to merge both the datasets. 

##Combining the datasets
combineData <- merge(Sleepday, EverydayActs, all = TRUE)
##Now plot the scatter plot for further insights. Do clean the combined data before plotting
ggplot(data = combineData, aes(x = TotalMinutesAsleep, y = TotalSteps))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(colour = "purple")+ labs(title = 'Total Steps vs. Total Minutes Asleep', x = 'Total Minutes Asleep', y = 'Total Steps')
#Correlation Formula
cor(combineData$TotalSteps, combineData$TotalMinutesAsleep, method=c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"))

This is interesting because it gives negative correlation between the mentioned parameters as we can observe from the plotsome people who are walking above the average, but sleeping below recommended hours but then we also have those who are walking the average daily steps,but may be sleeping more than the hours recommended. Hence, the relationship cannot be established as it is quite vague.

4. User activity trend in minutes.
This we can do to check what activities are getting logged by the users in the app. We have 4 distinctions in types of activity based on minutes Sedentary, Very Active, Fairly Active and Lightly Active Minutes. So, in this case we will try to create a pie chart for this.

##import plotrix package
install.packages("plotrix")
library("plotrix")

##Finding total minutes in every individual activity type
Sedentary <- sum(combineData$SedentaryMinutes)
Active <- sum(combineData$VeryActiveMinutes)
Fairly <- sum(combineData$FairlyActiveMinutes)
Lightly <- sum(combineData$LightlyActiveMinutes)

##creating pie chart
x <- c(Sedentary,Lightly,Fairly,Active)
labels <- c("Sedentary", "Lightly Active", "Fairly Active", "Very Active")
lab <- paste0(round(x/sum(x) * 100, 2), "%")
col <- hcl.colors(length(x), "Spectral")
pie3D(x,main = "Active Minutes Of Users (in Percent)", col = hcl.colors(length(x), "Spectral"),shade = 0.5,theta = 1.5, labels = lab)
legend("topright",c("Sedentary", "Lightly Active", "Fairly Active", "Very Active"),cex = 0.7, fill = col)

This pie chart shows us that users spend 76.81% time in day inactive and only 2.3% of the time as very active. This trend can be used to encourage users to increase their daily active minutes and reduce sedentary minutes by being more active through the day.

SHARE

In this step we interpret our results and share them with help of visualisations. Here, we have used R itself for the purpose of visualization. Based on the insights we have gathered we can interpret our results as - 
1. Sedentary minutes takes the biggest proportion in terms of time spent by users on the app, which means the app is rarely being used to track the fitness and health of users.
2. The positive correlation between Total Time In Bed and Total Minutes Asleep can be another avenue of exploration as it can be tracked further to improve sleeping habits.
3. Another positive correlation between total steps and calories burned can be used to encourage users who wish to drop or maintain their weights without having having to go to gyms.

ACT

This step is where we act on our findings, i.e., give final conclusion on the analysis. Now, we had three issues to take care of at the beginning of the analysis, They were -
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

So, based on our analysis we can conclude that -
1. Majority of users use the FitBit app to track sedentary activities and not the fitness. Also, Users who have walked more steps have ended up burning more calories throughout the course of the day.

2. These trends can be applied to Bellabeat customers as well, they could set up a reward based daily steps goal which can be used to motivate their customers to walk more. They can also give notifications if a customer has been sedentary for an hour.

3. The marketing team of bellabeat can use these trends to encourage users by educating them about fitness, health and based on sleep data, they can also create awareness regarding the issues caused by Sleep deprivation.
